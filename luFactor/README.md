# luFactor.m
## About luFactor.m
The luFactor.m algorithm will take in a user's coefficient matrix that must be symmetrical, and performs a seriers of pivoting and gauss eliminations untill the function outputs the usar with a lower triangular matrix, upper triangular matrix, pivot matrix, and then finally the original matrix.
## Inputs
* Coefficient Matrix of a function
## Outputs
* Lower Triangular Matrix
* Upper Triangular Matix
* Pivot Matrix
* Original "A" Matrix
## More about luFactor.m
In order for the function to work the usar must input a symmetric coefficient matrix. If the usar fails to do this an error message will be displayed.
